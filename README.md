2. **Database Interaction:** Connect to a PostgreSQL database for data storage.
3. **Docker Containerization:** Package your application into a Docker container for easy deployment and scaling.
4. **Security:** Implement security measures to protect your APIs.
5. **[Other Features]:** Mention any additional features or functionalities specific to your project.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** The primary framework for building the backend.
- **PostgreSQL:** The relational database management system used for data storage.
- **Docker:** Containerization technology for packaging and deploying your application.
- **[Other Technologies]:** List any other technologies or libraries used in your project.
